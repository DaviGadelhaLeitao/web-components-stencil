Advantages of using Stencil that by it's turn uses JSX.

- Stencil is a tool that allow us to write a more error free code, thanks to TypeScript (strongly typed).

- Stencil uses JSX that in the end compiles to JavaScript, or to commands that will actually render the appropriate
HTML content to the screen, but that will happen behind the scenes, and you as a developer can use this HTML in JS
syntax you don't have to manually write code that access the DOM and writes it's content.

- Stencil has a couple of conveniences included, for example it has a couple of features that will automatically
re-render a render() when you change some inputs for that render(). As examples for these inputs are the @Prop(), the
properties of a component class, and if any these change then the Stencil will re-render the screen and update the DOM
automatically. What I mean by that, is that Stencil will output code that gives us a web component that has all the code
in it to automatically watch such properties and then update the DOM. And it gives us a nicer syntax for doing so.
